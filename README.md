# The book of Shaka

## Description

The Book of Shaka a Rails app to create (eventually) and use online, shared character
sheet for the tabletop roleplaying game Forbidden Lands.

It aims at being very minimalistic, and very manual, compared to a feature-rich,
automated VTT. Basically, it's a character sheet that several people can look
at at the same time, where you can keep track of your stats, consumables, etc.
Manually.

There's also a dice roller, because sharing the results of your dice rolls
is also useful when playing online â€“ especially if the GM has to explain to
new players the meaning of the special results and the different types of
dice when using the Year Zero Engine.

## Contributing

This is a pet project and a playground for me, so I cannot guarantee that
contributions will be accepted, but you're definitely free to use the code,
fork the project and have fun with it.
